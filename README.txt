This plugin provides two tag clouds:

1. Display your tags in a spiral, starting outside from the most-used tags.
2. Display your tags in horizontal waves, starting left from the most-used tags.

These tag clouds can be inserted in posts and pages with shortcodes or in widget areas with widgets.

Please don't expect the tag clouds to look perfect out of the box. There is a variety of parameters to fine-tune the size, the number of waves, cycles, distances and so on and you will need to adjust them to the number of tags, the available space and so on.

You can find more information on the [plugin website](https://chattymango.com/creative-tag-cloud/?pk_campaign=ctc&pk_kwd=readme "plugin website").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the tag clouds with colors? =

Yes. The plugin comes with a default palette that can be activated in the widget or by adding color=1 to the shortcode. You will need some basic skills in CSS for custom colors.

= Can I use a spiral that goes from the center to the edge? =

Sorry, that is not possible.

= Can I use waves that go from the right side to the left? =

Sorry, that is not possible.

= Do these tag clouds look the same in all browsers? =

I briefly tested them in all modern browsers. There may, however, be small differences how they render.
